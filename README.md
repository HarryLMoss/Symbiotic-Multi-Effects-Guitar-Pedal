# Symbiotic Multi-Effects Guitar Pedal

This repository houses the Symbiotic Multi-Effects Guitar Pedal project, a comprehensive endeavor undertaken as part of my 3rd year University project for a BEng Electronic Engineering degree at the University of Manchester, UK. This project spanned from September 2021 to May 2022 and showcases a blend of hardware and software engineering skills, focusing on digital signal processing for audio effects.

## Overview
The Symbiotic Multi-Effects Guitar Pedal is an innovative solution for electric guitarists, offering a suite of effects including gain, distortion, echo, and reverb, all programmable via an easy-access user-friendly interface that is attached to the guitar body as opposed to the floor. Developed using C and Assembly language on a Blackfin BF706 processor, this project demonstrates my capability in embedded system design, digital signal processing, and low-level programming.

## Features
- **Gain Control:** Adjust the input signal's amplitude.
- **Distortion:** Offers both heavy and crunch distortion modes.
- **Echo:** Customizable echo length and decay.
- **Reverb:** Simulates different environments, such as halls and rooms.
- **Hardware Interaction:** GPIO for effect toggling and LED feedback.
- **Flash Memory Management:** For storing user presets.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ADSP-BF706 Development Board
- CrossCore Embedded Studio for development
- Basic understanding of digital signal processing and embedded systems

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in CrossCore Embedded Studio.
3. Ensure the ADSP-BF706 board is connected to your PC.
4. Build the project and flash it to the board following the instructions on [this document](https://github.com/HarryLMoss/Symbiotic-Multi-Effects-Guitar-Pedal/blob/5e248a305c71987d566fe53f30ccaba5e6649da4/Drivers/flash%20programming.docx).

## Usage
1. Power on the ADSP-BF706 board.
2. Connect your electric guitar to the input jack and an amplifier to the output.
3. Use the GPIO pins to toggle between different effects.
